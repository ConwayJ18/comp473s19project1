# comp473s19project1

This is the repository for Project 1 of COMP 363/463, offered by Loyola University Chicago in Spring 2019. The owners of this project are Jess Conway and Sofie Von Hatten. The official guidelines for the assignment can be found in the Specifications folder.

The file structure can be split into three parts: the view layer, the business layer, and the data access layer. This structure, and the UML diagram that describes how each file interacts, can be found in UML.jpeg

The easiest way to interact with this repo is to compile and run Driver.java using the Eclipse IDE. This will create a test object of each type and make a call to each of the methods in the DAL, in effect testing the entire project.

The initial submission of this project was made on 24 Feb 2019.
